# Self Watering System (Raspberry Pi)
In this project we have planned to create a self watering system. The reason we want to create this is to find a solution on how we can go on vacation, and come home to plants that are still alive because of regular watering.

The idea is to measure the moisture in the soil to find out if the plant need more water. Based on how moist the soil is, a valve will open that water for x number of seconds before turning off again.

Thinking: If the moisture level is lower than X -> Open the water valve/run a water pump for X number of seconds.

Our team have never createt a project like this before, so we are looking forward to continue on the project.

## Goals of our project
- Setting up the raspberry and connect the soil moisture sensor 
- Get values from the soil moisture sensor through the raspberry 
- Create a source code that opens a valve/run a water pump based on the value from the soil moisture sensor
- Implement the Blynk application into our code so that we could see the soil moisture levels on our phones
- Implement a function that open the valve/run a water pump through the Blynk application

## Requirements
Essensielt equipment:
- Raspberry Pi 3b +                              
- Jumper cables         
- Soil moisture sensor                            
- Valve/water pump                                
- Water container
- PVS Hose 
- Blynk Application

In addition to this equipment, we are going to use our own laptops (pc and mac) as well as our phones (IOS - iPhones)
